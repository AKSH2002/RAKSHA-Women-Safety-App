# Reverse Engineering

Reverse-engineering is the act of dismantling an object to see how it works. It is done primarily to analyze and gain knowledge about the way something works but often is used to duplicate or enhance the object


# RAKSHA-Women-Safety-App.

It‚Äôs all about women's safety involves strategies, practices and policies which aim to reduce gender-based violence

The safety of women is a concern of increasing urgency in India and other country. There is problem of not responding quickly to call of distress. To overcome the these constraints there is application like Raksha women safety app and we are doing an reverse engineering on that application.
